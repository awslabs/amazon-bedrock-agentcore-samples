Load Sample Claim-Note Documents into OpenSearch Serverless

This script:
1. Reads the AOSS collection endpoint from SSM.
2. Idempotent-creates the `claim-notes` index with the spec mapping
   (owner_user_sub keyword, note_text text, claim_id/note_type keyword,
   created_at date).
3. Discovers test-user subs from SSM (<idp>-user-*-sub keys: okta-user-* written
   by setup_okta.py in notebook 01, cognito-user-* by seed_cognito_user_subs.py)
   and bulk-loads DISJOINT free-text claim-note documents per user.

Data distinctness (per design §4):
- Notes are FREE-TEXT (adjuster narratives, damage descriptions, call
  summaries), qualitatively different from the structured claims records
  served by the Claims_MCP_Server (which carry claim_id, claim_status,
  claim_amount, etc.). The agent's tool choice should be obvious from the
  question shape: note-search => notes/* (this server); structured
  claims/amounts/status => claims/* (Claims_MCP_Server).
- note_type ∈ {adjuster_note, call_summary, damage_assessment}.
- Per-user content is disjoint: each user gets its own 3-document set keyed
  by the user's LABEL (NOTES_BY_LABEL[label]), and every claim_id is
  label-prefixed ("CLM-<label>-<suffix>"). User A's claim_ids cannot appear
  under user B's owner_user_sub filter, so the notebook 07 isolation
  invariant is testable by simple set-difference.

# Canonical LABEL-KEYED note fixture. Each of the 5 test-user labels maps to
# its own list of 3 disjoint free-text notes; each note is a 3-tuple of
# (note_type, claim_id_suffix, note_text). Assignment is by LABEL (not by the
# user's position in the sorted sub list), so a user always receives the same
# notes regardless of how many other users are seeded — this prevents the
# earlier off-by-one (12 templates / 4 slices vs 5 seeded users) and the
# positional-slice coupling. claim_id is "CLM-<label>-<suffix>", so both
# claim_ids and narrative content are disjoint across users by construction.
#
# All notes describe insurance-claim *narratives* with no structured amount/
# status fields in the payload; the agent should pick this tool when the
# user asks about damage descriptions, adjuster commentary, call history,
# etc., and pick the claims/* tools when the user asks about totals,
# pending counts, or specific claim_id lookups.
