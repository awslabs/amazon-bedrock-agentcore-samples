"""
Dependency-free ``.env`` loader for the script (CLI) path.

Why this exists: the notebooks call ``init_aws()``, which loads ``.env`` as a
side effect, so the notebook path has always worked. The **scripts** documented
as ``python setup_okta.py`` never loaded ``.env`` at all — they read
``os.environ`` directly, so the documented CLI path only worked if the reader had
already exported the variables by hand. A harness-driven or CI deploy takes the
script path, which made this a real gap rather than a cosmetic one.

``python-dotenv`` is deliberately NOT used: it is not a declared dependency of
this sample, and the one script that imported it (``utils/check_runtime.py``) was
relying on an undeclared import that happens to be present in some environments.
The parser below is ~15 lines, so removing the dependency is cheaper than pinning
it (and DR-19's lesson is that every unpinned dependency is a future breakage).

Semantics match ``python-dotenv``'s default: **an already-exported environment
variable wins.** ``.env`` supplies values that are missing, it never overrides
the shell. That precedence matters — it is what lets an operator override one
value for a single run without editing the file.

Note the deliberate contrast with ``aws_session_utils.load_env_credentials``,
which **overwrites** ``os.environ`` and is AWS-credential-specific (it reports
failure when a ``.env`` holds no AWS keys). That function keeps its behaviour for
the notebook credential-refresh flow; this one is the general-purpose loader for
config such as ``OKTA_ORG_URL`` / ``OKTA_API_TOKEN``.

Usage from a deployment script::

    import os
    import sys

    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../.."))
    from utils.env_file import load_env_file

    load_env_file()

def find_env_file(start: Path | None = None) -> Path | None:
    """
    Locate the ``.env`` to use, searching upward from ``start`` (default: cwd).

    Scripts in this sample run with a variety of working directories — the
    notebooks run from the sample root, while the deployment scripts run from
    ``deployment/<step>/`` — so a plain ``Path.cwd() / ".env"`` finds the file for
    one caller and misses it for the other. Searching upward means the same call
    works from anywhere in the tree, and the sample root (where ``.env.example``
    lives, and therefore where readers put ``.env``) is always on the path.

    Args:
        start: Directory to begin the search from. Defaults to the current
            working directory.

    The **nearest** ``.env`` wins, which is the conventional rule but has one
    consequence worth knowing: if a ``.env`` exists both at the sample root and in
    ``deployment/``, a script under ``deployment/<step>/`` reads the latter while a
    notebook run from the sample root reads the former. The loader always prints
    the path it used, so a divergence is visible rather than silent.

    Returns:
        The first ``.env`` found at or above ``start``, or the sample root's
        ``.env`` as a final fallback, or None if neither exists.

    still parses.
