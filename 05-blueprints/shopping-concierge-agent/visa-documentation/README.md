## Quick Navigation

### For First-Time Implementation
1. Read the [Visa Payment Integration Guide](visa-payment-integration-guide.md) to understand the overall flow
2. Review the [Travel Booking Diagram](travel-booking-sequence-diagram.md) or [Shopping Diagram](shopping-sequence-diagram.md) to visualize the sequence
3. Refer back to the Visa Payment Integration Guide for detailed step-by-step instructions

## Key Concepts

### The Three Visa Services
- **VTS (Visa Token Service)** - Converts card numbers to secure tokens and manages device binding
- **VIC (Visa Intelligent Commerce)** - Orchestrates payment transactions and generates cryptograms
- **Auth iFrame** - Provides secure passkey creation and authentication interface

### The Two Phases
1. **One-Time Setup** (Phases 2-3)
   - Card tokenization
   - Passkey creation and device binding
   
2. **Per-Transaction** (Phases 4-5)
   - Passkey authentication
   - Payment credential generation
   - Transaction completion

## Contributing

When updating this documentation:
- Verify all information against the source API documentation
- Avoid adding speculative security explanations
- Keep implementation suggestions (not prescriptive requirements)
- Update both diagrams if the flow changes
- Maintain consistency across all three documents
